# gload.h - single-header only OpenGL loader

</div>

gload.h is a single-header only legacy, modern and embedded-systems OpenGL loader, based on the official KhronosGroup's OpenGL Registry.
It's simple, easy to use, highly configurable with support for GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows Operating Systems.

## Usage

gload.h is designed to be simple drag-n-drop library for your common C/C++ projects. Simply include it in your project.
There's no need to link with any library, unless you explicitly specify one of 3 backends: GLX, EGL or WGL.

```c
#define GLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "gload.h"

int main(void) {
    if (!gloadLoadGL()) { return (1); }

    /* ... */
    
    glClearColor(1.0, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    /* ... */

    return (0);
}
```
